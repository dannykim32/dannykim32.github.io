                <ul>
                    I had the opportunity to spend 10 days at Living Stone Boys' Seminary in Tanzania along with a team from my church. Living Stone is a primary school for boys and one of the first Christian primary schools in Tanzania. My team and I had the opportunity to teach class, lead evening worship, and help encourage the staff of the school. Coming from an engineering background, I was able to teach math, physics, and engineering-related courses to a total of more than 250 students. I enjoyed the challenge of tailoring my lesson plan to the ranging academic backgrounds of each class. During my time there I was quickly reminded that an individual's circumstances does not preclude them learning from one another. Although there were differences in upbringing and education, I felt that I received more insight about compassion, honor, and sincrecity than I gave. This trip for me was not about giving to the less fortunate. Rather, it was about coming to realization that people and their value in the world goes significantly beyond their circumstances.

                 <ul>
                    In March of 2018, I have the opportunity to volunteer for Life Impact International, an organization focused on helping children escape poverty, hopelessness and exploitation. Although I cannot share explicit details of the trip due to safety issues, I know that this will be a life-changing experience. I plan to utilize my computer engineering background to help the staff and base deal with any technological issues and help improve their current operations. I also am planning games for our team to play with the children there during our time.

                <h4>Childrens' Game Leader</h4>
                 <ul>
                    Every summer, my local church hosts a Vacation Bible School (VBS) for elementary-aged children. The staff hosts a week-long school that focuses on teaching about the bible, helping kids make new friends, and giving the kids another way of enjoying the summer. Through the day, we do several activities with the kids such as crafts, snacks, and games. I primarily serve as the gamemaster. I plan games for 50 kids at a time to focus on teamwork and encouraging each other.
